# About *Quantum Kittens*


From marbles that are red and blue at the same time to feathers that spontaneously appear and disappear, the cat world is a little funkier than ours. *Quantum Kittens*, an illustrated creative non-fiction dive into their world, teaches quantum computing from a non-technical perspective suitable for high school age upwards.

Quantum concepts are portrayed through stories about curious cats who live in Whiskerton, a town governed by the laws of quantum physics. Each story is accompanied by a commentary section with layperson explanations. A reader can choose to read them together, or just stick to the stories and avoid the explanations altogether.
